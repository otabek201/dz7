                One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from <br> troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his <br>
                bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like <br> back, and if he lifted his head a little he
                could see his <br> brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches <br> into stiff sections. The
                bedding was hardly able to <br> cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. <br>
                His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, <br> waved about helplessly as
                he <br> looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                although a <br> little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
